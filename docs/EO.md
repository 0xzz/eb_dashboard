###### How COVID-19 and April's Executive Order will impact EBer?
* COVID-19 is impacting the world in all aspect, including US employment-base immigration system. At the current moment, it is difficult to quantitatively estimate the impact of COIVD-19 to the immigration process. However, we can still provide a few opinions based on our understanding.
* In late Apr 2020, the Trump administration issued an executive order (EO), putting green card processing for applicants outside the US on pause for at least 60 days. It is still unclear if this order will be effective and how long it will last eventually. Also, the administration also warned that it is considering a second order that might completely change the life of hundreds of thousands temporary workers (primarily on H1B VISA holders). It is still unclear how this second order will turn out to be, when or whether it will be issued.
* Due to the global quarantine, COVID-19 has led to an artificial economic crisis, resulting in an unprecedented high unemployment rate. Although this is believed to be temporary by many people, there could be some long-term by-effect that might improve or harm the current employment-based immigration system.
* For applicants filed inside US (i.e., via I-485): Together with the EO, COVID-19 has been, and will continue for a while, significantly reducing the demand directly from outside the US (i.e., Consular Processing). This could lead to an overall reduction of green card demand, and can potential help advance the VISA bulletin in a faster than before speed. We have already seen a slightly faster-than-previous-anticipated advancing speed in the recently released May VISA bulletin. Note that this VISA bulletin is not believed to be impacted by the EO yet. The June VISA bulletin will show the impact of EO in a clearer way.
* For applicants filed outside US (i.e., via CP): Unfortunately, the green card process for CP has been suspended by the EO. It is still unclear when this will recover. On the bright side, the CP immigration program is not terminated. Once the EO expired, the VISA number will be again issued to CP applicant.
* COVID-19 has led to some serious corporative reorg/layoff, putting many EB applicants' legal status on crisis. In fact, other than applicants under EB1A, EB2-NIW, most EB applicants that are laid off will need to find a job almost immediately to maintain their legal status. Otherwise their 140 might be void. This, although might sound very brutal, will effectively reduce the demand of green card, leading to a faster advancing speed. The recent oil-price-crisis might also lead to some serious impacts to many applicants.
* USCIS field offices have been shut down for a while, offering no interviews. There are some cases that people reporting obtaining EB green card without being interviewed. It is, however, still believed that the amount of immediate green card demand, especially from the countries and categories that are current (i.e., EB1-row, EB2-row). This could lead to a small internal resource reallocation, i.e., advancing the rest countries and categories (EB1-China, EB1-India, EB2-China, EB2-India) in a slightly faster pace.
* Once the EO becomes effective, the family-based immigration system will be seriously, if not completely, harmed. It is almost certain that most of Family-based VISA numbers will not be used in the FY2020. According to the DOS/USCIS policy, these unused VISA numbers will be provided to EB-based immigrant in the next fiscal year, i.e., FY2021 starting from Oct 2020. A bigger "spill-over" (SO) from FB will provide more VISA numbers to the EB category, leading to a faster green card processing time.
* We wish you best of luck staying wellbeing and sound in the current harsh environment, and get greened soon!
